So basically this project covers all of lab 2 endpoints(almost) the createcourse and student enroll course are full however the teacher is not full.
authentication by role is provided kindly check my services that helped me communicate with firebase and achieve jwt authentication. you can check its
functionality by registering a new email and then login to that email, it will return a jwt token that you can copy and try it in postman.
you can also find in the mediator file all the queries/commands.
please note that the studentcontroller is named Courses I was hurried to submit. like /api/Courses/Enroll in addition I should have created only one login endpoint
but in the last commit I added a login for the students,admins and teachers. kindly forgive my silly mistakes.
